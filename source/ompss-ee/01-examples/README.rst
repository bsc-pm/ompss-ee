Examples Using OmpSs
====================

In this section we include several OmpSs applications that are already parallelized (i.e. annotated
with OmpSs directives). Users have not to change the code, but they are encouraged to experiment
with them. You can also use that source directory to experiment with the different compiler
and runtime options, as well as the different instrumentation plugins provided with your OmpSs
installation.
