Multisort

.. highlight:: c

This codes performs a vector sort. There are two ways to implement this with tasks:
Parallelizing with tasks in the leaf level (what we call "leaf" version") and in the
non-leaf levels ("tree" version").

To analyze the trace, load the task_execution.cfg file. It is available in the Paraver folder
(cgfs/OpenMP/views) or in the cfgs folder in the upper level.
